            <p><em>Did you know that 60% of crop yields depend on soil fertility? Soil is a precious resource that needs to
                be
                managed carefully. As a farmer, you can do this by performing soil tests on a regular basis. Want to know
                more
                about why testing soil is so important? AgroCares gives you 5 reasons to test your soil.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <strong>1) Gain knowledge about the soil condition and how to
              </strong><strong>improve it</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>Fertile soils are necessary to grow healthy crops. To improve soil fertility, it needs to be measured first.
              Soil fertility is determined by the chemical, physical and biological properties of soil. &nbsp;Properties
              such
              as soil texture, colour and structure are visible. However, it is impossible to see the chemical composition
              of
              soil. This is what needs to be measured and why soil sampling is essential. Soil tests are used to determine
              the
              nutrient content and pH level of a soil. With this information the exact type and quantity
              of&nbsp;fertiliser&nbsp;that needs to be applied to improve soil fertility can be defined.</p>
            <h4>
              <strong>2) It is the first step into soil fertility
                management</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>With a proper soil fertility management strategy, farmers can maximize the efficiency of nutrients and water
              use and improve their agricultural productivity.&nbsp;Soil testing is the first step towards proper soil
              fertility management. Soil testing gives valuable information and helps you improve your soil’s health.</p>
            <h4>
              <strong>3) Minimise fertiliser&nbsp;expenditures</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>You will not waste money on unnecessary&nbsp;fertilisers if the exact type and quantity
              of&nbsp;fertilisers&nbsp;your soil and crops need is known. Moreover, inorganic&nbsp;fertilisers in general
              and
              nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium are limited resources. Their prices are increasing over the years
              and
              because this trend is set to last it is clever to adapt now to the inevitable changes.</p>
            <h4>
              <strong>4) Avoid over-fertilisation</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>Applying&nbsp;fertiliser&nbsp;without knowing the actual nutrient needs of your soil might lead to
              over-fertilisation. By testing your soils and receiving&nbsp;fertiliser&nbsp;recommendations, you can avoid
              using an excessive amount of&nbsp;fertiliser. This is better for your crops and the environment.
              Fertiliser&nbsp;burn and leaves turning yellow is the outcome of over-fertilisation for crops. It&nbsp;might
              also result in nutrient leaching, water pollution and irreversible damages to the surrounding aquatic life.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <strong>5) Avoid soil degradation</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>Soil degradation is a threat to every farmer. It is estimated that each year&nbsp;<a
                href="http://www.globalagriculture.org/report-topics/soil-fertility-and-erosion.html">24
                billion&nbsp;tonnes</a> of fertile soil are lost due to erosion which is a result of unbalanced soil
              management. A proper soil management is guaranteed by soil tests followed by the application of the
              right&nbsp;fertilisers&nbsp;at the right moment. Besides avoiding risks of soil degradation, it is a more
              efficient and financially more interesting practice. Moreover, soil restoration is a difficult, costly and
              time-consuming process.</p>
